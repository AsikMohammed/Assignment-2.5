Clusters:
     
           Generally A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software.
     The components of a cluster are usually connected to each other through fast local area networks ("LAN"), with each node (computer used as a server) running its own instance of an operating system

Hadoop Clusters:
      
           A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment. 
      Hadoop clusters are comprised of three different node types: master nodes, worker nodes, and client nodes. 
      a.) Master nodes oversee the following key operations that comprise Hadoop: storing data in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and running parallel computations on that data using MapReduce. 
      b.) The NameNode coordinates the data storage function (with the HDFS), while the JobTracker oversees and coordinates the parallel processing of data using MapReduce.
      c.) Client nodes have Hadoop installed with all the cluster settings, but are neither master or worker nodes. 
          Instead, the client node loads data into the cluster, submits MapReduce jobs describing how that data should be processed, and then retrieves or views the results of the job when processing is finished.

Rack:
      
           Storage of Nodes is called as rack. A rack is a collection of 30 or 40 nodes that are physically stored close together and are all connected to the same network switch. A Node is simply a computer. This is typically non-enterprise, commodity hardware for nodes that contain data 
      Network bandwidth between any two nodes in rack is greater than bandwidth between two nodes on different racks.A Hadoop Cluster is a collection of racks.

Rack Awareness:
      
           Rack awareness is having the knowledge of Cluster topology or more specifically how the different data nodes are distributed across the racks of a Hadoop cluster. 
      The importance of this knowledge relies on this assumption that collocated data nodes inside a specific rack will have more bandwidth and less latency whereas two data nodes in separate racks will have comparatively less bandwidth and higher latency.
     Hadoop components are rack-aware. For example, HDFS block placement will use rack awareness for fault tolerance by placing one block replica on a different rack. This provides data availability in the event of a network switch failure or partition within the cluster.

The main purpose of Rack awareness is:
      1.) Increasing the availability of data block
      2.) Better cluster performance
      3.) Rack awareness increases data availability. Also the HDFS balancer and decommissioning of data nodes are rack aware operations.

Example:
      Let us consider a typical Hadoop cluster setup for 4500 nodes:
      In this case Hadoop Cluster would consists of
      a.)110 different racks
      b.)Each rack would have around 40 slave machine
      c.)At the top of each rack there is a rack switch
      d.)Each slave machine(rack server in a rack) has cables coming out it from both the ends
      e.)Cables are connected to rack switch at the top which means that top rack switch will have around 80 ports
      f.)There are global 8 core switches
      g.)The rack switch has uplinks connected to core switches and hence connecting all other racks with uniform bandwidth, forming the Cluster
